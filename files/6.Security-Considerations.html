                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                    <p>
                        This is intended to be a brief overview of some 
things you should keep in mind when installing Nagios, so as set it up 
in a secure manner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your monitoring box should be viewed as a 
backdoor into your other systems. In many cases, the Nagios server might
 be allowed access through firewalls in order to monitor remote servers.
 In most all cases, it is allowed to query those remote servers for 
various information. Monitoring servers are always given a certain level
 of trust in order to query remote systems. This presents a potential 
attacker with an attractive backdoor to your systems. An attacker might 
have an easier time getting into your other systems if they compromise 
the monitoring server first. This is particularly true if you are making
 use of shared SSH keys in order to monitor remote systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If an intruder has the ability to submit check 
results or external commands to the Nagios daemon, they have the 
potential to submit bogus monitoring data, drive you nuts you with bogus
 notifications, or cause event handler scripts to be triggered. If you 
have event handler scripts that restart services, cycle power, etc. this
 could be particularly problematic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another area of concern is the ability for 
intruders to sniff monitoring data (status information) as it comes 
across the wire. If communication channels are not encrypted, attackers 
can gain valuable information by watching your monitoring information. 
Take as an example the following situation: An attacker captures 
monitoring data on the wire over a period of time and analyzes the 
typical CPU and disk load usage of your systems, along with the number 
of users that are typically logged into them. The attacker is then able 
to determine the best time to compromise a system and use its resources 
(CPU, etc.) without being noticed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here are some tips to help ensure that you keep 
your systems secure when implementing a Nagios-based monitoring 
solution...

                    <h4>Best Practices</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Use a Dedicated Monitoring Box</strong>.
 I would recommend that you install Nagios on a server that is dedicated
 to monitoring (and possibly other admin tasks). Protect your monitoring
 server as if it were one of the most important servers on your network.
 Keep running services to a minimum and lock down access to it via TCP 
wrappers, firewalls, etc. Since the Nagios server is allowed to talk to 
your servers and may be able to poke through your firewalls, allowing 
users access to your monitoring server can be a security risk.  
Remember, its always easier to gain root access through a system 
security hole if you have a local account on a box.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Don't Run Nagios As Root</strong>. 
Nagios doesn't need to run as root, so don't do it. You can tell Nagios 
to drop privileges after startup and run as another user/group by using 
the <a href="https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nagioscore/4/en/configmain.html#nagios_user">nagios_user</a> and <a href="https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nagioscore/4/en/configmain.html#nagios_group">nagios_group</a>
 directives in the main config file. If you need to execute event 
handlers or plugins which require root access, you might want to try 
using <a href="http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/sudo.html">sudo</a>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Lock Down The Check Result Directory</strong>. Make sure that only the <i>nagios</i> user is able to read/write in the <a href="https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nagioscore/4/en/configmain.html#check_result_path">check result path</a>. If users other than <i>nagios</i> (or <i>root</i>)
 are able to write to this directory, they could send fake host/service 
check results to the Nagios daemon.  This could result in annoyances 
(bogus notifications) or security problems (event handlers being kicked 
off).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Lock Down The External Command File</strong>. If you enable <a href="https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nagioscore/4/en/extcommands.html">external commands</a>, make sure you set proper permissions on the <i>/usr/local/nagios/var/rw</i> directory. You only want the Nagios user (usually <i>nagios</i>) and the web server user (usually <i>nobody</i>, <i>httpd</i>, <i>apache2</i>, or <i>www-data</i>)
 to have permissions to write to the command file. If you've installed 
Nagios on a machine that is dedicated to monitoring and admin tasks and 
is not used for public accounts, that should be fine. If you've 
installed it on a public or multi-user machine (not recommended), 
allowing the web server user to have write access to the command file 
can be a security problem. After all, you don't want just any user on 
your system controlling Nagios through the external command file. In 
this case, I would suggest only granting write access on the command 
file to the <i>nagios</i> user and using something like <a href="http://cgiwrap.sourceforge.net/">CGIWrap</a> to run the CGIs as the <i>nagios</i> user instead of <i>nobody</i>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Require Authentication In The CGIs</strong>.
 I would strongly suggest requiring authentication for accessing the 
CGIs. Once you do that, read the documentation on the default rights 
that authenticated contacts have, and only authorize specific contacts 
for additional rights as necessary. Instructions on setting up 
authentication and configuring authorization rights can be found <a href="https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nagioscore/4/en/cgiauth.html">here</a>. If you disable the CGI authentication features using the <a href="https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nagioscore/4/en/configcgi.html#use_authentication">use_authentication</a> directive in the CGI config file, the <a href="https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nagioscore/4/en/cgis.html#cmd_cgi">command CGI</a> will refuse to write any commands to the <a href="https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nagioscore/4/en/configmain.html#command_file">external command file</a>. After all, you don't want the world to be able to control Nagios do you?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Implement Enhanced CGI Security Measures</strong>. I would strongly suggest that you consider implementing enhanced security measures for the CGIs as described <a href="https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nagioscore/4/en/cgisecurity.html">here</a>.
 These measures can help ensure that the username/password you use to 
access the Nagios web interface are not intercepted by third parties.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Use Full Paths In Command Definitions</strong>. When you define commands, make sure you specify the <i>full path</i> (not a relative one) to any scripts or binaries you're executing.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Hide Sensitive Information With $USERn$ Macros</strong>. The CGIs read the <a href="https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nagioscore/4/en/configmain.html">main config file</a> and <a href="https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nagioscore/4/en/configobject.html">object config file(s)</a>,
 so you don't want to keep any sensitive information (usernames, 
passwords, etc) in there.  If you need to specify a username and/or 
password in a command definition use a $USERn$ <a href="https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nagioscore/4/en/macros.html">macro</a> to hide it. $USERn$ macros are defined in one or more <a href="https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nagioscore/4/en/configmain.html#resource_file">resource files</a>.
 The CGIs will not attempt to read the contents of resource files, so 
you can set more restrictive permissions (600 or 660) on them. See the 
sample <i>resource.cfg</i> file in the base of the Nagios distribution for an example of how to define $USERn$ macros.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Strip Dangerous Characters From Macros</strong>. Use the <a href="https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nagioscore/4/en/configmain.html#illegal_macro_output_chars">illegal_macro_output_chars</a>
 directive to strip dangerous characters from the $HOSTOUTPUT$, 
$SERVICEOUTPUT$, $HOSTPERFDATA$, and $SERVICEPERFDATA$ macros before 
they're used in notifications, etc. Dangerous characters can be anything
 that might be interpreted by the shell, thereby opening a security 
hole. An example of this is the presence of backtick (`) characters in 
the $HOSTOUTPUT$, $SERVICEOUTPUT$, $HOSTPERFDATA$, and/or 
$SERVICEPERFDATA$ macros, which could allow an attacker to execute an 
arbitrary command as the nagios user (one good reason not to run Nagios 
as the root user).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Secure Access to Remote Agents</strong>.
 Make sure you lock down access to agents (NRPE, NSClient, SNMP, etc.) 
on remote systems using firewalls, access lists, etc. You don't want 
everyone to be able to query your systems for status information. This 
information could be used by an attacker to execute remote event handler
 scripts or to determine the best times to go unnoticed.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Secure Communication Channels</strong>.
 Make sure you encrypt communication channels between different Nagios 
installations and between your Nagios servers and your monitoring agents
 whenever possible. You don't want someone to be able to sniff status 
information going across your network. This information could be used by
 an attacker to determine the best times to go unnoticed.
